# Angola — Semiotics of Scarcity (Market Entry)

This note captures how to translate the "scarcity semiotics" study into landing-page narrative and feature framing for Jila.

## 1) What we’re really selling

In Luanda, water is not framed as a utility service; it’s framed as:

- **Luta (struggle):** daily, exhausting, humiliating, time-consuming.
- **Garimpo (extraction):** scarcity monetized by informal actors.
- **Lotaria (lottery):** unpredictability of the grid and of billing.
- **Defense:** households and businesses operate in permanent risk management.

**So the product is not "smart" or "green".**
It’s a tool for:

- **Autonomy:** know your days left; decide before the crisis decides for you.
- **Defense:** reduce exposure to urgent purchases, unknown water quality, and price volatility.
- **Proof:** make consumption and history visible; reduce “phantom billing” arguments.

## 2) Narrative frame to capitalize on (landing page)

Use a 3-part story arc:

1. **Validate reality:** don’t promise a future paradise; acknowledge the present.
2. **Offer control:** convert uncertainty into measurable autonomy.
3. **Prove local presence:** show that Jila works *here* (Luanda constraints, infrastructure behavior, day-to-day routines).

Tone guideline:

- Align closer to **street-level clarity** (immediate, practical), not bureaucratic future tense.
- Avoid political positioning; villainize **uncertainty and predation**, not parties.

## 3) How to use the two new capabilities

### A) Verified water distribution points (free)

**What it means in this market:**

- Not just a “directory” — it’s **local intelligence** and a substitute for unreliable institutional information.
- It’s also **proof of boots-on-ground** credibility: verification requires presence.

**How to frame it:**

- “Where there is water now” (present tense).
- “Verified + crowd-sourced updates” (trust + speed).
- “600+ verified points in Luanda; growing weekly” (social proof anchored to reality).

Recommended wording patterns:

- “Mapa de pontos de água (chafarizes, girafas…) — verificados.”
- “Atualizado no terreno e pela comunidade.”
- “Feito para quem não pode depender da sorte.”

Where to surface it:

- Hero trust chips (credibility)
- Pillar **Conectar** (core capability)
- Free plan features (remove adoption friction)

### B) Device LED level indicator (works without mobile data)

**What it means in this market:**

- Solves the “decorative tech” skepticism: the device is visibly useful even when the internet isn’t.
- Matches reality: mobile data is intermittent; checking an app isn’t always possible.

How to frame it:

- “See it at a glance” + “works offline” + “no excuses”.
- Keep it simple: it’s **relief**, not “delight”.

Recommended wording patterns:

- “Luzes de nível — vê a água mesmo sem dados móveis.”
- “Informação no local, sem depender do telemóvel.”

Where to surface it:

- Device bundle bullets
- Trust principles (reliability / transparency)

## 4) Copy principles (practical)

- **Strict adherence to Local Lexicon (No "Silicon Valley" terms):**
  - ⛔️ **Marketplace:** No one uses this. Use **"Rede de vendedores"** or **"Contactos"**.
  - ⛔️ **Centros de Distribuição:** Too formal. Use **"Girafas"** (truck filling stations) and **"Chafarizes"** (public taps).
  - ⛔️ **Pontos de Água:** Too generic. Be specific: **"Girafas e Chafarizes"**.
  - ✅ **Tanques:** Preferred over "reservatórios" in casual speech, though both are okay.
  - ✅ **Cisterna:** The standard term for water truck.

- Prefer **relief words** over "innovation words":
  - Relief: “alívio”, “controlo”, “sem pânico”, “antes de acabar”, “sem surpresas”.
  - Avoid: “sustentável”, “verde”, “transformação”, “smart” (unless anchored to a pain point).

- Convert features into “defense tools”:
  - “Dias de autonomia” → defense against urgency pricing.
  - “Mapa de girafas e chafarizes” → defense against wasted trips and rumors.
  - “Histórico” → defense against billing disputes.
  - “LEDs” → defense against connectivity failures.

## 5) What to collect next (if we want to push this further)

- A small set of neighborhood-tagged proof points (Kilamba / Talatona / Viana).
- A minimal “verification protocol” description (what makes a point verified).
- A single, honest metric: “X points verified this month” (keeps the story grounded).
